## 💬 **Realistic User Experience Example**

Here's what the actual conversation flow looks like in GitHub Copilot:

### Initial Request
**User**: "Create a Rally story for implementing user authentication"

**Copilot**: 
```
🔐 I need to authenticate with Rally to create stories. 

Please follow these steps:
1. Copy this URL: https://rally-mcp-server.gcp.cloud/auth?state=abc123xyz
2. Open it in your browser
3. Sign in to Rally and authorize access
4. Once you see "Authentication successful", return here and type "authentication complete"

I'll wait for your confirmation before proceeding.
```

### After User Completes OAuth
**User**: "authentication complete"

**Copilot**:
```
✅ Great! Let me create that Rally story now...

📝 Rally story created successfully:
